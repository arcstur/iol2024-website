# Program

The 21st edition of IOL will happen from **July 23 to 31**, **2024**, in [Brasília](/where), the capital city of Brazil. The olympiad has a traditional calendar, currently expanding to a 7-days format. The event comprises:

* Two official competitions (Individual and in teams) – see the [rules for the competition](https://ioling.org/rules/IOL_Rules.pdf).
* Five unofficial games (Integration Game, Quiz, IOLwiki, Guess-the-country, IOL's Got Talent)
* Lectures and workshops about linguistics, languages and culture
* Visits and contacts with the local nature and culture
* Celebrations

In addition to the international gathering of **high-school students**, IOL also has two kinds of parallel activities:

* [Courses and workshops for **local teachers**](#teacher-s-program), reinforcing the bridge between the olympiad and the school;
* Meetings among **public and private protagonists**, in order to promote and enrich public policies regarding [education, language and diversity](/why#education-language-and-diversity).

The schematic, day-by-day calendar, will be as such:

# Teacher's Program

Among its many qualities, the IOL is an event with a great **potential for local transformation**, as it congregates students and teachers that are highly engaged in learning scientific knowledge. As such, it recalls the transformative power of education and inspires us to democratize a high-level education that values the interest for the knowing process, the investigative reasoning and the collective nature of science.

That is why we feel the need for channeling IOL's olympic fire to enrich the community of teachers and educators in Brazil, and more specifically from Brasilia's metropolitan area. That is why we formalized a **Teacher's Program**, in parallel with the first days of the delegations' program.

The aim of the event, in consonance to [IOL's aforementioned societal aims](/why#education-language-and-diversity), is to bring to school teachers perspectives for learning languages and linguistics in a way that:

* promotes respect and valorization of local and global linguistic and cultural diversity;
* prioritizes learning languages in a more naturalistic, descriptive approach, observing the language as it is and as it manifests;
* promotes activities based on autonomy, curiosity and investigation.

As such, it is also our aim to promote among School Teachers different tools and strategies drawn from Linguistics Olympiads (such as the self-sufficient problems or the development of categorization and investigation skills) or from convergent approaches (such as *Gramaticoteca* in Brazil, *laboratorios gramaticais* in Portugal or the *thinking linguistically approach* in the U.S.).

The activities would be led by professors from the Brazilian academic community but also from the IOL community. After all, we are sure that, among the organizers of the different Linguistics Olympiads, there is a great richness of experiences and conceptions that can be directly beneficial to the school environment. That is why *we want to invite you to propose a workshop for the event*. Proposals are open until **February 9th, 2024**.

We hope the teacher's event can generate good fruits and become a tradition for the next editions of IOL, giving back to education in different countries.
