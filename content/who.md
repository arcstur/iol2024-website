# Organizers

The IOL is an event organized by many hands, all contributing on a volunteer basis to its realization. Professors, teachers, former participants and enthusiasts from different countries gather in different organizing bodies, such as the Board, the International Organizing Committee, the Problem Committee and the Jury. In addition, each year's edition is organized by a Local Organizing Committee (LOC).

## Supporting Team

The LOC can only coordinate the IOL effort by counting with the help of several other kind and enthusiastic people – many of them former IOL or ELO (Brazilian Olympiad's last round) participants. Those include:
