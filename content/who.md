# Organizers

The IOL is an event organized by many hands, all contributing on a volunteer basis to its realization. Professors, teachers, former participants and enthusiasts from different countries gather in different organizing bodies, such as the Board, the International Organizing Committee, the Problem Committee and the Jury. In addition, each year's edition is organized by a Local Organizing Committee (LOC).

## Academic Council

The LOC is supported in all academic and scientific matters by the Academic Council, who gives valuable advices and institutional support for the best flow of the event. The Council is composed by:

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    |

## Supporting Team

The LOC can only coordinate the IOL effort by counting with the help of several other kind and enthusiastic people – many of them former IOL or ELO (Brazilian Olympiad's last round) participants. Those include:

## Institutions

In addition, the IOL 2024 is supported by various institutions. The organizational nucleus is drawn from [Olimpíada Brasileira de Linguística (OBL)](https://obling.org), the Brazilian counterpart of the Linguistics Olympiads. As such, we have direct strategic support from [Instituto Vertere](https://institutovertere.org) and academic support from the [Brazilian Linguistics Association (ABRALIN)](https://www.abralin.org/site/).

The IOL 2024 is mainly sponsored by Brazil's [Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI)](https://www.gov.br/mcti/pt-br), as well as by the [Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/).

# Problem Committee and Jury

The academic nucleus of IOL is the **Problem Committee** (IOL PC) , a permanent body composed of researchers, teachers and former participants, all experienced solvers, testers and composers of the genre of Self-sufficient linguistics problems. The PC works the whole year in the multilingual composition of the problems, in order to guarantee that *all language versions of the problems are functionally equal*. You can read more about it [here](https://ioling.org/pc/).

During the event, the academic work (distributing the problems, overseeing the exams, marking the papers, presenting solutions, giving awards) is done by an International Jury, composed by members drawn from the PC. The International Jury for IOL 2024 is composed by:

# Volunteers

In addition to the permanent bodies and to the LOC, running the actual IOL involves a lot of hands-on activities, performed by a group of national and international volunteers – working especially in coordinating, escorting and concierge-ing the students, but also preparing activities, distributing materials and keeping the flow and the energy of daily-life at IOL.

The team of volunteers for IOL 2024 was selected in January and February as a diverse team composed by enthusiastic, experienced and linguistics-loving individuals – and as the Local Organizing Team we deeply thank everyone who offered themselves. The final team are the following people:
