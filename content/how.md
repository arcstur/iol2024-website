# Registration

Registration for IOL 2024 is made by representatives of accredited National Linguistics Olympiads, via IOL's Registration System. Each accredited country can participate with one or two teams, each team composed of 1 team leader (legally adult both in Brazil and in the country of origin) and 4 contestants (pre-university students, less than 20 years old on the first day of the competition, selected from an accredited National Olympiad). Additionally, the delegations can bring additional adult Observers at request.

## Instructions

If you are already registered in the system for IOL 2023, you can log in normally. If you aren’t, you have to put your real name, a valid e-mail and a valid phone number. In this case, your registration has to be approved manually, so please wait up to 3 working days.

Normally, the registration of a Delegation must be made by a representative or a team leader of a National Linguistics Olympiad that is accredited by IOL.

Once logged in, the registration has four layers:

1. Register your **country/national olympiad** for IOL 2024. You have to declare some initial data: number of teams, number of observers, working languages and some basic information about your National Olympiad. *This is the step you must fulfill in order to register a Delegation.*

2. Create your **teams**. Choose their names and select the working language for the team contest for each of them.

3. Create the **members of the delegation**: contestants, team leaders and observers. You'll need to put names, documents, personal details, room preferences, dietary requirements, working language, assign arrival and departure transport records, etc.

4. Create your **arrival and departure transport** records in a specific tab: type of transport, number, date and time of arrival or departure. After that you can attribute the created trajectories to specific people of your delegation.

Please notice that *only one user should register the whole delegation of a country.*

**Jury members**, **Volunteers** and **Observers** not connected to a Delegation must register by themselves, following similar steps.

# Working languages

At IOL, we consider that all participants have the right to solve the problems in their own native language (or one of them). The problems are composed in parallel in all working languages, in a way that *all language versions are equal* – meaning that no participant has advantages in solving the problems in any particular language.

However, because the multilingual composition is a lengthy and complex process, we need the Delegations to inform us in advance about the possible working languages for your Delegation.

You have to inform your possible working languages by **February 12th, 2024**.

Please, do keep in mind that the choice of a working language is an iterative process. As soon as the selection is finished and you know that a certain working language will not be needed in 2024, *please contact us as soon as possible to withdraw the language*, so the Problem Committee can stop working on its version.

According to the Rules for participants, a competitor can change their language choice up to two weeks before the Olympiad begins, but only being able to choose from the languages in the final list of working languages.
